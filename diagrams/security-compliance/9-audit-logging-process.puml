end note

== User Action and Logging ==

user -> app: 1. Perform sensitive action\n(login, data access, config change)
activate app

app -> app: 2. Process user request

app -> logger: 3. Generate audit event\n(user_id, action, resource, timestamp)
activate logger

logger -> logger: 4. Enrich audit data:\n- IP address\n- User agent\n- Session ID\n- Risk score

logger -> logger: 5. Apply data classification\n(PII masking, sensitivity level)

logger -> aggregator: 6. Send audit log\n(structured JSON format)
activate aggregator
deactivate logger

app --> user: 7. Action completed\n(response to user)
deactivate app

== Log Processing and Storage ==

aggregator -> aggregator: 8. Validate log format\nand integrity

aggregator -> aggregator: 9. Apply retention policies\n(based on data type)

aggregator -> auditdb: 10. Store audit log\n(encrypted, immutable)
activate auditdb
auditdb --> aggregator: 11. Log stored with hash
deactivate auditdb

aggregator -> analyzer: 12. Forward for analysis\n(real-time processing)
activate analyzer
deactivate aggregator

== Real-time Analysis ==

analyzer -> analyzer: 13. Pattern analysis:\n- Anomaly detection\n- Risk assessment\n- Compliance checks

alt Suspicious Activity Detected
    analyzer -> dashboard: 14a. Generate alert\n(high-risk activity)
    activate dashboard
    dashboard -> officer: 15a. Send notification\n(email/SMS alert)
    deactivate dashboard
else Normal Activity
    analyzer -> analyzer: 14b. Update metrics\n(compliance scores)
end

deactivate analyzer

== Compliance Review Process ==

officer -> dashboard: 16. Access compliance dashboard
activate dashboard
activate officer

dashboard -> auditdb: 17. Query audit logs\n(filtered by criteria)
activate auditdb
auditdb --> dashboard: 18. Audit trail data\n(user actions, timestamps)
deactivate auditdb

dashboard -> dashboard: 19. Generate reports:\n- Access patterns\n- Policy violations\n- Risk assessments

dashboard --> officer: 20. Display audit reports\n(charts, tables, alerts)

officer -> officer: 21. Review findings:\n- Investigate anomalies\n- Verify compliance\n- Document issues

alt Compliance Issue Found
    officer -> dashboard: 22a. Create incident\n(violation details)
    dashboard -> app: 23a. Trigger remediation\n(disable account, alert admin)
    activate app
    app --> dashboard: 24a. Action confirmed
    deactivate app
else Compliance Satisfied
    officer -> dashboard: 22b. Mark as reviewed\n(compliance approved)
end

deactivate dashboard
deactivate officer

== Audit Trail Integrity ==

auditdb -> auditdb: 25. Periodic integrity check\n(hash verification)

auditdb -> auditdb: 26. Backup audit logs\n(to secure archive)
