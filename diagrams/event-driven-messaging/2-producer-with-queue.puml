!define RECTANGLE class

RECTANGLE Producer {
  + produceMessage()
  + sendToQueue()
}

RECTANGLE Queue {
  + enqueue(message)
  + dequeue()
  + size()
}

RECTANGLE Consumer {
  + pullFromQueue()
  + processMessage()
}

  until consumers are ready
  to process them
end note

  at its own pace and
  processes them
end note
