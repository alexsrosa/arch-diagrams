# Architecture Diagrams Documentation

This project contains a comprehensive collection of architecture diagrams organized by themes, demonstrating different patterns, solutions, and architectural evolutions for modern systems.

## 📋 Diagram Index

### 🏗️ [Architecture Evolution - Containerization](docs/arch-evolution-containerization.md)
Diagrams showing the evolution from a monolithic architecture to a complete cloud-native architecture using containers and Kubernetes.

**Topics covered:** Monolith → Docker → Kubernetes → Microservices → Service Mesh → Cloud Native

### 📈 [Architecture Evolution - Incremental Steps](docs/arch-evolution-steps.md)
Detailed sequence of steps to evolve a simple application into a modern distributed architecture.

**Topics covered:** Simple Application → Frontend/Backend Separation → API Gateway → Microservices → Observability

### 📨 [Event-Driven Architecture and Messaging](docs/event-driven-messaging.md)
Patterns and solutions for event-based systems, message queues, and asynchronous communication.

**Topics covered:** Producer/Consumer → Pub/Sub → Kafka → Dead Letter Queue → Event Sourcing → CQRS

### ⚡ [Scalability and Performance](docs/scalability-performance.md)
Solutions for performance optimization, horizontal and vertical scalability, and high availability patterns.

**Topics covered:** Scaling → Caching → CDN → Database Sharding → Circuit Breaker → Multi-Region

### 🔒 [Security and Compliance](docs/security-compliance.md)
Security implementations, authentication, authorization, and regulatory compliance.

**Topics covered:** Authentication → OAuth2/OIDC → RBAC → Encryption → GDPR → PCI-DSS → Zero Trust

### 🔄 [Sequence Diagrams - Solutions](docs/sequence-diagram-solutions.md)
Detailed sequence diagrams showing communication flows between components in different scenarios.

**Topics covered:** Login → REST APIs → gRPC → Microservices → Retry Logic → Observability
